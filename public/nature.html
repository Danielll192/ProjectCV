<h1>Walk in the nature</h1>
<h2>
  Nature is a charger for my soul, if my phone haves low battery i put it on a
  charger, when my body and soul is tired, i go to the nature to charge it.

  <i>I love walk in the nature with my girlfriend, named Tina, we were in the High
  Tatras last year, they are really really beautiful mountains in Slovakia. We
  were there in November for 5 days, unfortunately it was mostly foggy and the
  we didn't see the mountains but when the fog lifted, it was incredebly to see
  how beautiful the nature is. We decided to go back this year in summer to see
  how the mountains looks in summer sunshine and to hike in mountain routes.</i>

<h4>Nová Lesná, the village where our hotel was, on the wood table is writing "Village with most beautiful view to Tatras". I'm sure it's 100% true.</h4>
