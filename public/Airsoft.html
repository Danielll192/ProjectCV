<h2>what is airsoft?</h2>
<p>
  Airsoft is a team-based shooting game in which participants eliminate opposing
  players out of play by shooting them with spherical plastic projectiles (BB-s)
  shot from airsoft guns.

  The Airsoft guns are made 100% to look like real guns, with all accessories,
  what you can see on the images as well, such as the airsoft gears like helmets
  and vests.
